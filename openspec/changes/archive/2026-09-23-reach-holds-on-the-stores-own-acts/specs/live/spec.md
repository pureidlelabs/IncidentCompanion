## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Written prose is edited together, not saved over

Prose an analyst writes into a report MUST be editable by two analysts at once without either losing work, and without one having to wait for the other.

This is the one place where the last write does not win and a version check is the wrong instrument: two people typing in one paragraph are not making conflicting claims about a fact, they are writing a sentence together.

Where an analyst is disconnected while writing, their work MUST survive and MUST merge when they return.

#### Scenario: Two analysts write in one section

- GIVEN two analysts editing the same passage
- WHEN both type
- THEN both sets of words survive
- AND neither is asked to resolve a conflict

#### Scenario: An analyst writes while disconnected

- GIVEN an analyst who loses their connection mid-sentence
- WHEN they reconnect
- THEN what they wrote is present
- AND merged with whatever arrived while they were away

#### Scenario: One of the writers loses write before the words are stored

- GIVEN two analysts writing in one passage
- WHEN one of them loses write before what both typed is stored
- THEN both sets of words are stored
